## udm\_\_Progress\_to\_cpp17

Code snippets and examples from the **Udemy** course [Progress to C++17](https://www.udemy.com/course/update-to-cpp17/). Understand the new language features in **C++17**

This is 2-nd (for me) course from [James Raynard](https://www.udemy.com/user/jamesraynard/).  
Other the author's courses I've completed:

*   #1 [udm\_\_Learn\_Advanced\_Modern\_CPP\_11\_14](https://github.com/AndreyMaksimov/udm__Learn_Advanced_Modern_CPP_11_14)

My [cerificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-9c35f219-3a5f-4a34-8c53-d04d93e8b861/).

Original git repo: [JamesRaynard/Update-to-Cpp17](https://github.com/JamesRaynard/Update-to-Cpp17)

I copied some interesting for me samples.

Then

*   reworked a bit
*   organized as a **CMake** project
